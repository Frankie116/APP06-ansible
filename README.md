## version  2.0
## Project: APP06-ansible (Public server branch)
## Purpose: To create an Ansible environment using terraform with master/slave servers.  
## This lab will be used to experiment with ansible configurations.
## Ansible servers have been moved to a public subnet to enable visual code to connect to them easier.
## (It as a bit tricky to connect to them via a jumpbox using visual code.)
## This project was initially created using APP05 as a template.
