## Project: TF-ansible-test-network
Purpose: To create an Ansible environment using terraform with master/slave servers.  

This lab will be used to experiment with ansible configurations.

Ansible servers have been moved to a public subnet to enable visual code to connect to them easier.

This project was initially created using APP05 as a template.
